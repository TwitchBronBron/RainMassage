            <p>
                I graduated high school a semester early and quickly enrolled in massage school. I completed the massage program in a little
                under 8 months, acquiring 750 hours of book experience and hands-on training. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA.
                After spending several months preparing, I scheduled my licensing exam and passed, becoming a licensed massage
                therapist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my career working locally with some surrounding spas and resorts within Pike and Wayne counties in Pennsylvania
                in 2012. I have now relocated and am serving the Lehigh Valley to include Lehigh, Northampton, Monroe, parts
                of Berks and Bucks Counties. I did spend a short time working as an intern with a local chiropractor, but
                I have more of a desire to focus on personal clients and being able to do my own scheduling, different types
                of therapies, and be able to coordinate with my clients' personal lives on a day to day basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am very passionate about massage and differing types of therapy. I love using Lotions, creams and gels from Natural Formulations
                Company, which contain all natural ingredients and some certified organic products. I strive to make massage
                as therapeutic as possible and I'm not driven by making money but by helping people have a better quality
                of life.
