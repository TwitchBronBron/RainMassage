                    I graduated high school a semester early and quickly enrolled in massage school. I completed the massage program in a little
                    under 8 months, acquiring 750 hours of book experience and hands-on training. I graduated with a 3.9
                    GPA. After spending several months preparing, I scheduled my licensing exam and passed, becoming a licensed
                    massage therapist.

                    I started my career working locally with some surrounding spas and resorts within Pike and Wayne counties in Pennsylvania
                    in 2012. I have now relocated and am serving the Lehigh Valley to include Lehigh, Northampton, Monroe,
                    parts of Berks and Bucks Counties. I did spend a short time working as an intern with a local chiropractor,
                    but I have more of a desire to focus on personal clients and being able to do my own scheduling, different
                    types of therapies, and be able to coordinate with my clients' personal lives on a day to day basis.

                    I am very passionate about massage and differing types of therapy. I love using Lotions, creams and gels from Natural Formulations
                    Company, which contain all natural ingredients and some certified organic products. I strive to make
                    massage as therapeutic as possible and I'm not driven by making money but by helping people have a better
                    quality of life.
