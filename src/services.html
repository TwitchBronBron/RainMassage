            We currently offer the following services:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>30 Minute Swedish Massage: $35.00 </b>
            <br/> A 30 minute Swedish Massage can be either a full body massage or a focused area massage, focusing on the back,
            arms, legs front and back, neck, shoulders, hands, feet, glutes or abdominal muscles. The focused area massage
            is designed to release tension in any part of the body that is irritated, tense, tight, or is simply in need
            of special attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>60 Minute Swedish Massage: $60.00</b>
            <br/> A 60 Minute Swedish Massage generally consists of the face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, legs front and back,
            glutes, back, feet, and sometimes a scalp massage depending on preference. Abdominal muscles can be included
            per request.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>90 Minute Swedish Massage: $90.00</b>
            <br/> A 90 Minute Swedish Massage is an extended version of the 60 Minute Swedish Massage. The massage includes face,
            neck, shoulders, arms, hands, legs front and back, glutes, back, feet, and a scalp massage depending on preference.
            Abdominal Muscles can be included per request. With a 90 Minute Swedish Massage, the muscles endure and experience
            a longer time period allowing for a deep relaxation or deep therapeutic relief massage.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Special Attention Massage: $1 Per Minute of Massage. (Massages under 40 Minutes will be charged a service fee
                of $5.00, unless more than one massage is being given to multiple people at one location)
            </b>
            <br/>Special Attention Massage is helpful when you are pressed for time and only have 40-45 minutes to spare instead
            of the full hour. With this massage, you can focus on one arm, one leg, the back, the neck, the hands, the feet,
            the calves, the thighs, or the whole body. It is entirely up to you.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
            <b>*NOTE: </b>Due to the individuality of the individual's build, muscles, and therapy goals. Special attention
            can be paid to any of the muscles listed above in order to provide a better therapeutic massage experience as
            well as to provide release of tensed muscles needing more time. Any part of any massage can be omitted per request.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>60 Minute Couples Teaching Massage: $70.00</b>
            <br /> A 60 minute massage where the LMT teaches you and your significant other how to massage each other. The massage
            therapist will show you the technique and how to apply it to your loved one; and then the roles get switched
            and they learn to massage you. Typically the arms, shoulders, and back are where most people have issues, but
            any adjustment can be made for this service. If your hands, feet, and legs give you issues, the therapist can
            show you and your loved one how to work out the tensity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>60 Minute Prenatal/Postpartum Massage: $63.00</b>
            <br/> An hour long prenatal massage is great for moms to be! It's an hour of relaxation, stretching, and pure bliss.
            The client will lay on their side on the massage table and have multiple pillows for comfort. We also offer Postpartum
            massages for individuals that are still in recovery from having a baby!
            <p>
                <b>60 or 90 Minute Hot &/or Cold Stone Massage: $65.00 & $95.00</b>
                <br/>
                <b>Note: Hot stone available now. Cold stone coming soon.</b>
                <br/> A hot &/or cold stone massage can be performed in 60 minutes or 90 minutes. The heat from the stones are
                sedative and help to reduce stress. Hot stone massage can help chronic pain to lessen, reduces muscle stiffness,
                and the heat from the stones expand blood vessels increasing circulation! Its the gold standard of relaxation
                with these water heated stones! The cold stone massage constricts the blood vessels in the body to help alleviate
                pain and swelling throughout the body. The cold stones are fantastic on trigger points without being invasive
                to the muscles. The cold stones are also great for cooling off and can be just as relaxing as the hot stone
                massage! Cold stones are great for clients that prefer cold over heat. Both hot and cold stones promote healing
                in their own way!
