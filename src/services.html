            <p>
                We currently offer the following services:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>30 Minute Swedish Massage: $35 </b>
                <br/> A 30 minute Swedish Massage can be either a full body massage or a focused area massage, focusing on the
                back, arms, legs front and back, neck, shoulders, hands, feet, glutes or abdominal muscles. The focused area
                massage is designed to release tension in any part of the body that is irritated, tense, tight, or is simply
                in need of special attention.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>60 Minute Swedish Massage: $60</b>
                <br/> A 60 Minute Swedish Massage generally consists of the face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, legs front and
                back, glutes, back, feet, and sometimes a scalp massage depending on preference. Abdominal muscles can be
                included per request.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>90 Minute Swedish Massage: $90</b>
                <br/> A 90 Minute Swedish Massage is an extended version of the 60 Minute Swedish Massage. The massage includes
                face, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, legs front and back, glutes, back, feet, and a scalp massage depending
                on preference. Abdominal Muscles can be included per request. With a 90 Minute Swedish Massage, the muscles
                endure and experience a longer time period allowing for a deep relaxation or deep therapeutic relief massage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Special Attention Massage: $1 Per Minute of Massage. (Massages under 40 Minutes will be charged a service
                    fee of $5, unless more than one massage is being given to multiple people at one location)
                </b>
                <br/>Special Attention Massage is helpful when you are pressed for time and only have 40-45 minutes to spare instead
                of the full hour. With this massage, you can focus on one arm, one leg, the back, the neck, the hands, the
                feet, the calves, the thighs, or the whole body. It is entirely up to you.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:20px;">
                <b>*NOTE: </b>Special attention can be paid to any of the muscles listed above in order to provide a better
                therapeutic massage experience as well as to provide release of tensed muscles needing more time. Any part
                of any massage can be omitted per request.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                <b>60 Minute Couples Teaching Massage: $70</b>
                <br /> A 60 minute massage where the LMT teaches you and your significant other how to massage each other. The
                massage therapist will show you the technique and how to apply it to your loved one; and then the roles get
                switched and they learn to massage you. Typically the arms, shoulders, and back are where most people have
                issues, but any adjustment can be made for this service. If your hands, feet, and legs give you issues, the
                therapist can show you and your loved one how to work out the tensity.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                <b>60 Minute Prenatal/Postpartum Massage: $63</b>
                <br/> An hour long prenatal massage is great for moms to be! It's an hour of relaxation, stretching, and pure
                bliss. The client will lay on their side on the massage table and have multiple pillows for comfort. We also
                offer Postpartum massages for individuals that are still in recovery from having a baby!
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>60 or 90 Minute Hot and/or Cold Stone Massage: $65 / $95</b>
                <br/>
                <i>
                    <b>Note:</b> Hot stone available now. Cold stone coming soon.</i>
                <br/> A hot and/or cold stone massage can be performed in 60 minutes or 90 minutes. The heat from the stones are
                sedative and help to reduce stress. Hot stone massage can help chronic pain to lessen, reduces muscle stiffness,
                and the heat from the stones expand blood vessels increasing circulation! Its the gold standard of relaxation
                with these water heated stones! The cold stone massage constricts the blood vessels in the body to help alleviate
                pain and swelling throughout the body. The cold stones are fantastic on trigger points without being invasive
                to the muscles. The cold stones are also great for cooling off and can be just as relaxing as the hot stone
                massage! Cold stones are great for clients that prefer cold over heat. Both hot and cold stones promote healing
                in their own way! A contrast massage can also be applied and is incredibly beneficial. You get the benefits
                of both Hot Stone
                <i>and</i> Cold Stone in one massage by alternating between the two methods!

                <b>Paraffin Wax Treatment: $10 per treatment.</b>
                <br/> The benefits of Paraffin wax seem to be endless. Some of the benefits include helping to relieve achy joints,
                relax stiff muscles, moisturize dry cracked skin, increase range of motion, rough working hands, open pores
                and increases circulation where ever applied. This treatment is not ideal for oily types of skin. This treatment
                leaves the skin soft, moisturized, and feeling great. Price will increase a little if more wax is needed
                for a larger body area (i.e. large area of the legs, entire forearm, back, etc. contact with questions).
                I use Therabath Paraffin Professional supplies. More information can be found
                <a href="http://www.therabathpro.com/about_paraffin_new.php">here</a>
                and
                <a href="http://www.therabathpro.com/treatments/tips.php">here</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/> A treatment is one of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Both hands</li>
                    <li>Both feet</li>
                    <li>Both elbows</li>
                    <li>Other treatment area (pricing at our discretion)</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Bamboo Massage: $38 / $63 / $93</b>
                <br/> Bamboo Massage is just as beneficial as a Swedish massage, only with longer lasting effects. A variety of
                smooth bamboo sticks and stones are used in this full body massage. The bamboo sticks allow the therapist
                to get better leverage when working on tense muscles, helping to deeply relax muscles, and may feel less
                invasive than certain deep tissue massages. The bamboo sticks can be used to knead and stretch facia and
                muscle in all directions, promote deep relaxation, and release trigger points, knots, and tension. Although
                only light to medium pressue is applied, the resulting effects are similar to those of a deep tissue massage.
                The bamboo massage sticks can be heated (similarly to hot stone massage) or can be used at room temperature.
                This massage can be performed in 30, 60, or 90 minute massage sessions.
